Etymology1.Noun.1 # An old [[unit of measure]] for volume of dry things, still used for potatoes in market squares. A modern '''''kappa''''' is equal to 5 [[liter|liters]] (''[[iso]] kappa''), or 2 liters (''[[pikku]] kappa''), but during the period of autonomy under Russia it was 1/30 of {{m|fi|tynnyri||barrel}} or 5.4961 liters, and before that under the Swedish rule it was 1/32 of ''tynnyri'' or 4.58 liters. A further complication is that Swedish and Russian barrels were not of equal size.
